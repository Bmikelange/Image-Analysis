The project was carried out under QT creator with the opencv library.
to compile it you need to install QT Creator.

In order to better understand the code, it is important to differentiate the interface from the processing code.

All the functions and processing elements are stored in the Mainwindow.h class

But only the interface functions are declared in the MainWindows.cpp file, all the processing functions are in the traitement.cpp file

the fileselector.h/cpp and image.h/cpp files are also totally dedicated to display.

the matrice.h/cpp and convexe.h/cpp files contain data structures useful for processing


This application need Qt Creator.
